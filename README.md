# Solidity Development & Security Portfolio

## About Me

I am a junior Solidity developer with a passion for building and learning about smart contracts and blockchain security. I have experience working on decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM-compatible networks. I am eager to improve my skills in smart contract development, security best practices, and optimizing blockchain solutions.

This repository contains various Solidity-related codes, covering aspects of programming, development, DeFi applications, EVM, and security. It serves as a collection of my learning progress and contributions to the Solidity ecosystem.
